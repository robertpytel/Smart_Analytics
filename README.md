This folder is for our graphing and teamwork.
We are going to make improvements to do something with crash sensor data soon.
Graphing Gyroscopes and Linear Acceleration.py graphs gyroscope and linear acceleration readings for the x, y, and z directions.
It takes as input Sensor_mini.csv, which contains ~8.3 minutes of driving data on the way to work.
